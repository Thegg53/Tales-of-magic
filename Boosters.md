# Boosters
## Draft Boosters
Meant for drafting, fully random cards

## Set Boosters
Like Draft boosters, but meant for Constructed players that dont care about drafting and just want to open the packs

## Jumpstart Boosters
Meant for jumpstart, meant to quick build decks, for easy gameplay. Replaces Theme Boosters.

## Theme Boosters (discontinued)
All cards (35 ish cards per booster) from the same color/theme, meant to help deckbuilding. No basic lands. In theory, these + basic lands from outside the booster could be used in a "Jumpstart like gameplay", but reviews say they were not good or balanced, and just because all cards are the same color, or say "Bird", doesnt make for a nice experience.

1 Theme booster + 25 lands = ready to Play.

You knew the color / color pair of the booster before opening it.

This could prove cheaper to Jumpstart AFTER we have a pile of basic lands, but not necessarily a good/fun/balanced.

## Collector Boosters
Expensive, fancy art/ foil cards etc
