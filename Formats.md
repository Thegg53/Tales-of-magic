1. Limited (deck made in the day of the game)  
    1.1. Draft (open pack, pass it around taking 1 card etc..)  
    1.2. Sealed (open 4-6 packs, make a deck)  
    1.3. Jumpstart (Use Jumpstart Packs, read note at end). Open 2 packs, shuffle and Play  
    1.4. Cube (more on this later)

2. Constructred (pre built decks)

    2.3. Modern (20 years ish)  
    2.4. Eternal (all time, 30 years ish)

        * 2.4.2. Vintage (no ban list, almost)  
        * 2.4.3. [Pauper](./formats/pauper.md) (commons only)  
            If a card has ever been printed (either physically or on MTGO) as common, it is pauper legal.

Many websites can check for Pauper Legality

    [Read more in the dedicated page](./formats/edh.md)
    
    3.1. Normal (EDH)  
    3.2. Pauper Commander (all commons, one uncommon can be the commander. I say the commander must be a legendary creature, other groups accept any legendary uncommon as the commander, we would need to agree).
