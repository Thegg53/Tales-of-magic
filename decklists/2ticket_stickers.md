Dreaming of some recursive creature that you want to perma buff? Think Cauldron Familiar that keeps coming back from the graveyard.  
Or you are looking into buffing a Crypt Rats so that you can board wipe repeatedly (and use something like Unearth/recomission/the new white Recomission like that gives a role).  
Then, this is what you should look for. Sorted by Thoughness and Total Stats. Remember the deck needs 10 of these, use the IDS to find what you need

- chicken troupe
- stiltstrider
- command performance
