This is a pile, for reference mostly. 

The idea here is that with a TortEx, you can for each { B } and 2 life, dredge 5 cards deep (using stinkweed imp and street wraith). With that, one should be able to really quickly get through the deck and dread return a lotleth giant or something to kill them. Liliana's elite can also be a cheap beater. Not sure if Exhume would be good here, it could potentially allow for turn 2 Troll of khazad dum or something.

If the idea is to use loot effects, like faithless looting and so, then madness creatures could be an option to get the required bodies for dread return. Not sure if that is better than unearth-ing (using the ability of dredgscape zombies), at least for kitchen imp where it costs 1 mana.

Overall, not even sure that this is any better than going the 1-land (to 3 or 4) land(s) spy version that aims to do the same.
