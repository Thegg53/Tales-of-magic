# EDH aka Commander (Elder Dragon Highlander)
One  legendary creature is your commander.   

You can only play cards of those colors and cards including lands that use the mana symbols in your commander. This is called color identity.  

## Notes: 
1. there are [commanders](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=oracle%3Abackground+%28type%3Acreature+type%3Alegendary%29+%28game%3Apaper%29) that use a ["Background"](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=%28type%3Aenchantment+type%3Abackground%29+%28game%3Apaper%29) (generally an enchantment). You get to use both the colors of the commander as well as from the background
1. You can use two commanders, if both use the ["Partner" mechanic](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=oracle%3Apartner+%28type%3Acreature+type%3Alegendary%29+%28game%3Apaper%29)  
1. Some [Planeswalkers can also be commanders](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=oracle%3Acommander+type%3Aplaneswalker+%28game%3Apaper%29).

## Pauper Commander (PDH)
One uncommon creature as your commander (partner/background also allowed), 99 common cards as your deck.  

Some people only accept legendary creatures. I would tend to agree with that, since that makes it a Commander deck. (exceptions accepted if you want a 3/4 color deck where no legendary uncommon exist).

### Competitive Pauper Commander (cPDH)
Similar to Pauper Commander, but everyone agrees that they are trying to win as most as possible (combos, quick kills etc)
