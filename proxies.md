# 1 - Download a decklist
https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/burn-3854fe58-5ff9-4046-bac9-ae9617c3caf5#paper

Press the "Download", and Select "Text File".

It should look like the example below. Copy all that text content 

```
4 Chain Lightning
3 Dwarven Forge-Chanter
4 Experimental Synthesizer
...
```

# 2 - Go to a website that generates the PDFs
I like: https://mtgprint.net/

Paste in the box, and click "Submit".  

You should see the card arts.  

You get to choose which edition the cards are (the more recent ones have easier/more texts. Remember some cards are over 30 years old, and the initial text might have been jankier).  

I toggle the "Skip Basic Lands", up to you.  

Press the "Print" button on the webpage, that should download a PDF.  

Take that PDF to your work, local library, whatever, print, cut, sleeve and enjoy :)
