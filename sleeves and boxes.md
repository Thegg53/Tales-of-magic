# NEVER BUY PENNY SLEEVES OR SOFT SLEEVES
Useless crap, very cheap, terrible.

## Sleeves 
If we ever want to be consistent, dragon shield is likely the best. Danish made, consistent and high quality. 


## Constructed -> Prebuilt decks
The matte (not the dual matte), tend to be the best. Black is a safe choice, clear is also good, but might show the card backs, and there are inconsistencies between magic sets -> https://www.dragonshield.com/webshop/solid-color-sleeves/70-dragon-shield-matte-black.html


### Jumpstart
Gamegenic Just Sleeves (box of 250). They seem to be [discontinued, this is their current offerings](https://www.gamegenic.com/product-category/card-sleeves/standard-sleeves/value-pack-200/), but since they are clear, should not be an issue to mix with other brands. 

I imagine that since the jumpstart will not be used that often, since we mix, getting a total of 500 of these clear is perfect for jumpstart. 3 players is 120 sleeves per session, so, 500 is at least 4 gaming sessions, more if we reuse packs (hence the boxes, see paragraph below)

## Jumpstart Deck Box
See the Jumpstart page. These boxes can be any color, and this isnt that critical. We can roll a dice, they serve only to store the used packs in a convenient way.

Hell, a cassette/tape (yes, the very old music thing) plastic box also works to store magic cards, I used to do that as a kid.
